# ORY Open Source Support for Enterprise 

ORY technology is available as open source. It is available to anyone and anyone can get started via the available documentation. The open source is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 

There is an active community of developers who support each other via the ORY chat and also via the community forum, and via the ORY blog and newsletter to which developers can subscribe to easily from https://ory.sh. There is also extensive developer documentation available via https://ory.sh/docs

Enterprises wanting assistance, guidance, and support for their implementations of ORY open source technology, above and beyond the self-service options have the option to buy an enterprise license from ORY Corp. The enterprise license provides support for maintaining and updating installations of ORY in production. More details of how the Open Source Support works is outlined below.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Support is only available as part of an ORY Enterprise License.

Customers who purchase an enterprise license get support via a dedicated category in the ORY Forum and have a dedicated Slack channel to communicate with members of the engineering team.

We generally try to make a first response to severe issues - those that are bugs or represent business outages, or are security critical -  within 1 business day, and attempt to find resolutions to these issues at a best effort. Issues raised that are less severe are responded to and resolved at best effort.

Enterprises looking for additional help or guidance can also purchase professional services that provide them with assistance in designing architecture, configuring specifics of the technology for specific purposes, creating optimized deployments, and getting input for maintaining and extending their deployment(s) of ORY optimally. Professional services are available from ORY directly at ORY daily rates. These services are available to anyone, can be bought seperately, and there is no requirement to purchase an enterprise license.
